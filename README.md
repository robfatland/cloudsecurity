# cloudsecurity
Notes in prep for the cloudbank security overview video.

## Why use AWS? 

We needed a single cloud for building a specific example case. It turns out that Amazon Web Services (AWS) was the most 
convenient. We always emphasize that the equivalent levels of security and reliability are available
from other public cloud platforms, in particular the Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform. We are not
endorsing any cloud platform and our intent as the program develops is to provide equivalent materials for other 
clouds in addition to AWS. Anticipating a parallel construction we are starting off with three corresponding folders. 

## What is cloud security?

Cloud **security** is the means by which cloud resources (which correspond to a use fee) are safeguarded against
unwanted use. Cloud security is closely tied to cloud **reliability**, the feature of the cloud that gives cloud
users confidence that their data and work will not be corrupted or lost. 

## Where next? 

To look at the resource materials used in the video click into the [AWS](AWS/README.md)
sub-folder and go from there.
